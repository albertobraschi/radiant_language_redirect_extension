= Language Redirect

Redirects to the appropriate language section based on the content
encoding preferred by the Web browser.

You can add a "config" part to the page which maps languages to URLs
in the following format:

  lang: url
  lang: url
  ...

Where "lang" refers to a language code and "url" refers to the URL
which should be redirected to based on the preferred content
encoding of the Web browser.

The following listing is a sample "config" page part:

  en: /en/
  ja: /ja/
  *: /en/

In this example, when the browser prefers English content it will be
redirected to the "/en/" URL. When it prefers Japanese content it will
be redirected to the "/ja/" URL. In the event that the browser prefers
something other than English or Japanese content, they will be
redirected to the "/en/" URL. This is what the "*" in the last entry
does. URLs can be either relative (without "http://hostname.tld") or
absolute (with "http://hostname.tld").

If no "config" part is specified the behavior will force the page to
redirect to the "/en/" folder.
